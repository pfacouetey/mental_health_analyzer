Steps to launch and test the app !
 
Install Docker Desktop from : https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
 
The application is composed of two docker images: backend and frontend.
backend runs on port number 8000 and frontend runs on port number 80.
 
1 - Create a folder and place the file `docker-compose.test.yml` in it.

2 - Open a terminal in that folder and run the following command: 
`docker compose -f .\docker-compose.test.yml -p mental-health up`

Wait until you see the backend server running on port number 8000

3 - Launch the app in localhost :
 
http://localhost:80
